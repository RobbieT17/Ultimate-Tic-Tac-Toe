# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This was a simple project of a game I love. Ultimate tic-tac-toe is a more complicated version of the original requiring a lot more skill and strategizing. 

## Goals
Create an online multiplayer experience so you can play with anyone at anytime.

## Progress
All the front-end coding is done. You can save games and come back to them later (this won't be a permenant featurea). All that is left is the multiplayer feature.

## How to Run
If you're using VSCode, add the live server extension then open. Right click on `index.html` then select "Open with Liver Server".
